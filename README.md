# Villa Jatica
This is the full source code for the [Villa Jatica webapp](https://villa-jatica.com/).
The app is built in [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and the database and hosting is on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 

## Why is this open source 

Jaspero benefits greatly from the open source community. This app in its entirety is made possible because of open source software. Because of this we try to open source as many of our projects as we can and the owners of this beautiful property have been gracious enough to allow us to do so.
